# Using AI to Make Some Images
It occurred to me that becoming a Web3 enabled digital panhandler is not very difficult.  Mainly I would generate a QR Code to my crypto address for Solana or some other token and incorporate some image.

## Using an LLM Image Generator Came to Mind
For a while I've been using Meta to make "Magic Crypto Baby Warrior."  Then switched to a passion of not being disturbed at work, or doing a passion project, or some other task.  Some of the original prompts used to create best works hit a usage limit, and after a pause of efforts for some days - it did not occur to me to save the prompts.  The free tier was the choice for me to produce the best results.

Microsoft Copilot was the main tool, here are the most recent prompts:

> Design a road sign with a message in industrial fonts: “Work, don’t help! Don’t help: work!” Incorporate a Men at Work logo. Use road sign yellow with black and reflective red and whites for the border parts. Make the sign look worn.

and
> Design a triangular road sign with a message in industrial fonts: “Work, don’t help! Don’t help: work!” Incorporate a men at work logo. Use road sign yellow with black and reflective red and whites for the border parts. Make the sign look worn.

Here are the results:
!["New Work Don't Help](/brookman1/assets/New_Work_Don_t_Help.png)

![New Work Don't Help 2](/brookman1/assets/New_Work_Don_t_Help_2.png)

Here are the results:
[New_Work_Don_t_Help.png](/brookman1/assets/New_Work_Don_t_Help.png "New_Work_Don_t_Help.png")
and 
[New_Work_Don_t_Help_2.png](/brookman1/assets/New_Work_Don_t_Help_2.png "New_Work_Don_t_Help_2.png")

Not sure how to get back to the original idea,
> The prompt used suggestions to: to make it like it would appear on a lunch box or a hardhat. 
[Yellow_and_Black%20Logo_Thin.png](/assets/Yellow_and_Black%20Logo_Thin.png "Yellow_and_Black%20Logo_Thin.png")

Possibly Copilot has changed and the above results are unreachable.  Save your prompts guys! 👈

## Some Images with Similar Prompt from Meta
The prompt will take some doing to get, if I still have it.
> Make it a sticker on a hardhat or a lunchbox was part of the prompt, make it fabric was picked from suggestions.

## Why I May Be Using Claude for the Rest of My Life.
Got these done.  The overall impression that comes to mind is that Copilot was trying to impress me when it first did my bidding.  

The very first thing in the training attempt for myself was "A Big Furry Dog Licking Glass" that was supposed to be a privacy screen for a window.

Quickly learned, from two attempts, that political statements are blocked as if this was recipe for cyanide.  Thanks Elon Musk YouTubes for featuring his says about it. 

## The Price of a Free Tier
Free is free, possibly the best way to learn.  I sure wish to get into n8n or a similar tool, and do some of my other secret projects, looks like there is a two-week deadline once it is initiated.  Not sure how to keep on working with the interruptions coming.
